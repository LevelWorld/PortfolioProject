Project: 
Super_Smash_Bro_Ultimate

This project is example of my abilites to collect data using webscraping techques. 
Using Pandas and SQL for organizing, cleaning, and exporting. 
Visualizations using tools like Tableau, and Power BI the data collected for this project to draw meaningful insights.

Data
The data is split into 2 folders. Offensive Data (i.e. grab reach, attack damage), 
and non-offensive data (i.e. weight, walking speed).

SQL
The SQL foldercontains sql scripts in attempt to find any correlation between traits. (i.e. does weight have anything to
do with walking speed, is that insight applied consitency or are there exceptions).

Visualizations
This folders contains visuals that are an attempt to show these insight drawn up from the folders mentioned above.
Ulimiately there will be a visualization of objective hierarchy of characters in this game. (A.k.a. a Tier List)
